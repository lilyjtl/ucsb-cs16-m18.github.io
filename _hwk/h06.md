<b>Reading: {{page.reading}}</b>
* Read Chapter 7.1 - 7.2 (up to and including the const parameter modifier) and Chapter 9.1 (up to and including uses of the assignment operator).
* It's recommended to write and observe the output for the code segments when working on this homework.

<ol start="1">

<li>(10 pts) Fill in the information in the header. The following are required to get the 10 "participation" points.
    <ul>
    <li>Filling in your name and umail address.<br /></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Also: For paper submission PLEASE submit on ONE SHEET OF PAPER, double-sided if at all possible. If you must submit on two printed sheets write name on BOTH sheets and no staples, paperclips, or folded corners.<br /></li>
    </ul>
</li>
<div style="margin-bottom:1em"></div>

<li> (5 pts) What is the output of the following code? If there's an error that will not allow an output, point it out and briefly justify your answer.

<div markdown="1">
```cpp
int arr[5];
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  if (i < 3)
    arr[i] = 'a';
  else
    arr[i] = 'z';
  cout << arr[i] << endl;
}
```
</div>
</li>

<div style="margin-bottom:2em"></div>
<li> (8 pts) What is the output of the following code? If there's an error that will not allow an output, point it out.

<div markdown="1">
```cpp
int arr[7] = {5};
for (int i = 0; i < 7; i++)
  cout << arr[i] + i << " ";
```
</div>
</li>

<div style="margin-bottom:4em"></div>
<li> (5 pts) What is the output of the following code? If there's an error that will not allow an output, point it out.

<div markdown="1">
```cpp
int codes[] = {44, 66, 83, 973, -977};
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  if ( (codes[i]/2) < 50 )
    cout << codes[i] << endl;
  else
    cout << "invalid" << endl;
}
```
</div>
</li>

<div class="pagebreak"></div>

<li> (6 pts) Draw a diagram to show how the content of the array 'nums' changes in memory after every line of the following code is executed. Start by showing the elements of the array in memory when the array is initialized. Every time the element of an array changes, you may indicate the change by crossing out the old value and writing in the new value.

<div markdown="1">
```cpp
int nums[] = {44, 66, 83};
int tmp = nums[0];
nums[0] = nums[1];
nums[1] = nums[2];
nums[2]= tmp;
```
</div>
</li>

<div style="margin-bottom:5em"></div>
<li> (10 pts) Write the definition of a function named 'reverse' that takes two parameters: an integer array and the number of elements of the array. The function should reverse the order of elements of the array with the given size. The function should not return anything. For full credit, include the entire function definition including the correct parameters and return type. See below for an example of expected outcome when the reverse function is called:

<div markdown="1">
```cpp
int nums[] = {10,20,30,40,50};
reverse(nums, 5); // The order of elements should be reversed after this
for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
   cout << nums[i] << " ";
```
</div>
The output of the above code should be: 50 40 30 20 10
</li>

<div style="margin-bottom:22em"></div>
<li> (6 pts) Draw a pointer diagram to demonstrate how the state of memory changes as the following code is executed. Cross out old values/arrows and draw new ones. Is this program likely to result in a segmentation fault? If so, why?
<div style="margin-bottom:1em"></div>

<div markdown="1">
```
  int num = 10, *ptr1 = &num, *ptr2=0;
  if (ptr2)
    ptr1 = ptr2;
  else if(ptr1)
    ptr2 = ptr1;
  (*ptr1)++;
```   
</div>
</li>
